Our project uses a mix of:
Javascript
HTML
CSS
Express
Three.js

Although we did not submit an initial proposal, this project is a Liar’s Dice game where you are able to play with other people through a server. Liar’s Dice is played as so:

Each player starts with a set of dice
Players take turns making bids on the total number of dice showing a certain value
Players can either raise the bid or challenge the previous
If challenged, all dice are shown, and if the bid was accurate, the challenger loses a die. If it was inaccurate, the bidder loses a die
The game continues until only one player has dice remaining, making them the winner

Using Three.js for models of the dice rolling, the player can challenge a call made, change their own call, and make the call. There will also be multiple screens to maneuver around such as a start screen, game screen, and end screen. The players are able to see the results of their own dice, as well as how many dice the other players have lost, and the current call. 

Using Javascript for the main part of our code, we will also use HTML and CSS in order to design our project in an appealing way for the users. We will also use an Express server to be accessed while the game is being played.
